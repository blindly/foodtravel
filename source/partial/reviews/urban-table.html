										<h1>Cedar + Stone: Urban Table</h1>

									<p>Remarkable, enticing, intrigued. Those are the words that come to mind when I think about Urban Table, and that's before addressing the food. We'll get into that later.</p>

									<h2>Interdum sed dapibus</h2>
									<p>I had woken up early in the morning and was ready for breakfast. It was 6:35 AM when I entered the restaurant. The atmosphere was alluring. The door was all glass and there was a table in the front. I stood as I waited to be seated. Dennis, the host, directed me to a table. I wanted another one and asked if I could have it. The one he was suggesting was right by the full wall glass window. From there, you could see the outside tables and the bridge. If you stood on the opposite side, you could read the name in the front: Mall of America.</p>

									<h2>Magna etiam veroeros</h2>
									<p>My server was Susan. She greeted me with a smile and asked what I wanted to drink. I asked for chai tea. I'm a fan ever since a friend taught me how to make it the Hindi way. Susan was happy to oblige. </p>

									<h2>Lorem aliquam bibendum</h2>
									<p>Susan came back and asked what I would have. I had looked at the menu, but I usually like to ask for a recommendation. That's my go-to line. That's how you can usually tell how good the place is. Susan recommended her 3 favorite dishes. I went with the Minnesota Skillet. </p>
                                    
                                    
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Lorem aliquam bibendum</h2>
									<p>On presentation alone, the dish was mouth watering. The heirloom potatoes were warm and soft. It was well seasoned with sauteed tomatoes and pemmican beef that melted in your mouth.  The feta cheese was delicious, and the over easy eggs were an excellent finishing touch. </p>
                                    
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Lorem aliquam bibendum</h2>
									<p>Susan was back to check up on me and was happy to hear it met my expectations. She was happy to offer more water and a tea to go as I enjoyed and finished the Skillet.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Lorem aliquam bibendum</h2>
									<p>If you are near Minneapolis and want to have an experience you won't soon forget, head towards Mall of America. There, you will find the JW Marriot. In their lobby, you will find one of the best kept secrets of Minnesota - Cedar + Stone: Urban Table. </p>
                                    
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Lorem aliquam bibendum</h2>
									<p>Don't be afraid to check the menu for your favorite dish, or if you want to try something different, ask your server for their favorite dish. If your server is like Susan, you will be in for a treat. </p>
